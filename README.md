# Natural-Language-Programming
Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. At its core, NLP aims to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. It combines techniques from linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to analyze text and speech data, allowing machines to perform a wide range of tasks such as sentiment analysis, language translation, chatbots, and information retrieval. By converting unstructured human language into a structured format that machines can process, NLP plays a critical role in developing applications that can communicate with us, summarize documents, and extract key insights from vast amounts of text data.
